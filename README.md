# react-clearbit-autocomplete

A simple React input component that will autocomplete company names, logos, and domains from the [Clearbit Autocomplete API](http://blog.clearbit.com/company-autocomplete-api/). Useful in all types of user registration flows.


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [ccnixon.github.io/react-clearbit-autocomplete](http://ccnixon.github.io/react-clearbit-autocomplete/)

Live PlayGround: [https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-Kl-xoPzf4vNaeYouui_](https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-Kl-xoPzf4vNaeYouui_)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-clearbit-autocomplete is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-clearbit-autocomplete.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-clearbit-autocomplete --save
```


## Usage

Example usage:

```js
var ClearbitAutocomplete = require('react-clearbit-autocomplete');

var App = React.createClass({

  processCompany: function(company){
    console.log(company);
  },

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <ClearbitAutocomplete 
          id="autocomplete"
          onClick={this.processCompany} />
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

### Properties

### `companiesProps: Object` (optional)
Default Value: `{ id: 'companies' }`

Object of properties to pass into the autocomplete results menu. This is div that will contain the return company results after each keystroke. Useful to designate an id, className, or styles.

### `companyProps: Object` (optional)
Default Value: `{ className: 'company' }`

Object of properties to pass into each individual company result in the autocomplete menu.

### `inputProps: Object` (optional)
Default Value: `{}`

Object of properties to pass into actual user input element.

If you want to enable users to input & store a value that didn't match a Clearbit known company, you can use inputProps to pass a function to onKeyUp which is not utilized by the core autocomplete component.
```
  inputProps={{name: 'current_company', onKeyUp: this.storeCompany}}
```

### `onClick: Function` (required)

Handler function to be called after a user has selected a company.

### `placeholder: String`
Default Value: `'Company name...'`

String to use as the placeholder value of the input element.

### `renderResults: Function`
Default Value: (see below)

Optional function to be used to render the returned query results. Defaults to a basic div with nested span and img tags.


### Notes

This is an early version. Tests are forthcoming. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.


## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
